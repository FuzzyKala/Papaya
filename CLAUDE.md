# Papaya - AI Feedback System Refactoring Guide

## Project Overview

Papaya is a complete rewrite of the AI Feedback System using modern technologies to create a more maintainable, scalable, and beginner-friendly codebase. This project transforms a complex multi-service application into a streamlined Next.js full-stack application.

## Original Project Analysis

The original AI Feedback System (git@github.com:Summer-project-25-AI-Feedback-system/AI-Feedback-System.git) has several architectural challenges:

### Current Architecture Issues

- **Complexity**: Separate client, server, and API services create unnecessary complexity
- **Code Duplication**: Similar files (`Aievalutions.ts`, `Aievolution.ts`) suggest duplicate logic
- **Multiple Technologies**: React+Vite frontend, Express.js backend, Supabase database creates maintenance overhead
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services require complex orchestration
- **Learning Curve**: Difficult for beginners due to scattered architecture

### Current Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Passport.js, GitHub OAuth
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

## New Tech Stack & Rationale

### Technology Choices

#### Next.js 15+ (Full-Stack Framework)

- **Why**: Eliminates client/server separation complexity
- **Benefits**:
  - Server Components for better performance
  - API routes eliminate separate backend
  - Built-in optimization and deployment
  - Simpler project structure
  - Better SEO and loading performance

#### PostgreSQL + Prisma (Database Layer)

- **Why**: More mature than Supabase for learning, better performance
- **Benefits**:
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Migration management
  - Better for production deployments
  - Clear schema definition

#### TailwindCSS (Styling)

- **Why**: Already used, proven effective
- **Benefits**: Utility-first approach, consistent design system

#### Docker + GHCR (Deployment)

- **Why**: Industry standard for modern deployments
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent environments
  - Easy scaling
  - Production-ready
  - GitHub integration

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization Principles

1. **Feature-Based Structure**: Group related files by feature, not by type
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
3. **Reusability**: Create composable, reusable components and utilities
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for better developer experience
5. **Performance**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals and user experience

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case for files (`user-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`UserDashboard`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`getUserData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`)
- **Types**: PascalCase with descriptive names (`UserProfile`)

### Git Workflow

- **Branches**: `feature/stage-{number}-{description}`
- **Commits**: Conventional commits format
- **PRs**: One PR per stage with comprehensive testing
- **Reviews**: Self-review checklist before requesting review
